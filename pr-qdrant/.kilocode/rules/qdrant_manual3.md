Local Quickstart
How to Get Started with Qdrant Locally
In this short example, you will use the Python Client to create a Collection, load data into it and run a basic search query.

Before you start, please make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.
Download and run
First, download the latest Qdrant image from Dockerhub:

docker pull qdrant/qdrant

Then, run the service:

docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v "$(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z" \
    qdrant/qdrant

On Windows, you may need to create a named Docker volume instead of mounting a local folder.
Under the default configuration all data will be stored in the ./qdrant_storage directory. This will also be the only directory that both the Container and the host machine can both see.

Qdrant is now accessible:

REST API: localhost:6333
Web UI: localhost:6333/dashboard
GRPC API: localhost:6334
Initialize the client
python
typescript
rust
java
csharp
go
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")

By default, Qdrant starts with no encryption or authentication . This means anyone with network access to your machine can access your Qdrant container instance. Please read Security carefully for details on how to secure your instance.
Create a collection
You will be storing all of your vector data in a Qdrant collection. Let’s call it test_collection. This collection will be using a dot product distance metric to compare vectors.

python
typescript
rust
java
csharp
go
from qdrant_client.models import Distance, VectorParams

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="test_collection",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=4, distance=Distance.DOT),
)

Add vectors
Let’s now add a few vectors with a payload. Payloads are other data you want to associate with the vector:

python
typescript
rust
java
csharp
go
from qdrant_client.models import PointStruct

operation_info = client.upsert(
    collection_name="test_collection",
    wait=True,
    points=[
        PointStruct(id=1, vector=[0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74], payload={"city": "Berlin"}),
        PointStruct(id=2, vector=[0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11], payload={"city": "London"}),
        PointStruct(id=3, vector=[0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94], payload={"city": "Moscow"}),
        PointStruct(id=4, vector=[0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80], payload={"city": "New York"}),
        PointStruct(id=5, vector=[0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44], payload={"city": "Beijing"}),
        PointStruct(id=6, vector=[0.35, 0.08, 0.11, 0.44], payload={"city": "Mumbai"}),
    ],
)

print(operation_info)

Response:

python
typescript
rust
java
csharp
go
operation_id=0 status=<UpdateStatus.COMPLETED: 'completed'>

Run a query
Let’s ask a basic question - Which of our stored vectors are most similar to the query vector [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7]?

python
typescript
rust
java
csharp
go
search_result = client.query_points(
    collection_name="test_collection",
    query=[0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    with_payload=False,
    limit=3
).points

print(search_result)

Response:

[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "version": 0,
    "score": 1.362,
    "payload": null,
    "vector": null
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "version": 0,
    "score": 1.273,
    "payload": null,
    "vector": null
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "version": 0,
    "score": 1.208,
    "payload": null,
    "vector": null
  }
]

The results are returned in decreasing similarity order. Note that payload and vector data is missing in these results by default. See payload and vector in the result on how to enable it.
